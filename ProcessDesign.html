			<div>
			Process engineering includes a total spectrum of engineering industries; for example, food,chemical, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and petrochemical. It deals with the methods of converting or scrutinizing materials in choosen form and distribution in chemical or physical form. The basic aim of this course is on the skills required to work in a process department of an organization and design office of a manufacturing unit. A vast area of simulation softwares are used for this purpose.)
